## Runtime
A **runtime** is the period when a program is actively executing. In environments like Google Colab, the runtime can disconnect after inactivity or due to resource allocation policies, leading to loss of temporary data.

**Example:**  
When Google Colab disconnects, all uploaded data and installed libraries are lost, requiring a fresh setup.

## Execute the script
To **execute a script** means to run a Python file in an environment where the code is interpreted and performed by the system.

**Example:**  
Running `python script.py` in the terminal executes `script.py`.

---

## Dependencies
**Dependencies** refer to external libraries or modules that a Python project requires to function properly. These are usually installed using package managers like `pip`.

**Example:**  
If a project requires `numpy` for numerical computations, install it using:

```bash
pip install numpy
